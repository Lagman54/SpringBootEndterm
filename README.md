# SpringBootEndterm Project 🚀

This project is a microservices-based application built with Spring Boot. It includes separate services for `Order` and `Delivery`, integrated via Kafka. The project uses PostgreSQL for persistence and Flyway for database migrations.

---

## 📁 Modules

- `Order`: Handles order creation and communication with the Delivery service.
- `Delivery`: Listens for order events and schedules deliveries.
- `docker`: Contains the Kafka and Zookeeper setup via Docker Compose.

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### ✅ Prerequisites
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Java 17
- Maven
- PostgreSQL installed and running

---

## 🧪 Setup Database

### 1. Create databases (drop schemas if they exist):

```postgresql
CREATE DATABASE order_db;
CREATE DATABASE delivery_db;
```

### 2. Create development user:

```postgresql
CREATE USER dev_user WITH PASSWORD 'secret123';
ALTER ROLE dev_user WITH SUPERUSER;
```

> ⚠️ Flyway will run automatically on application startup using the SQL files from:
```
delivery/src/main/resources/db/migration
```

---

## 🛰️ Start Kafka & Zookeeper

From the `docker/` directory:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Services

Navigate into each service (`Order`, `Delivery`) and run one of the following:

With Maven:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

With Maven Wrapper:
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
